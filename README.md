# An automatic plotter for my criterion benchmarks

Over time, my criterion benchmarks have ended up following some common
conventions. And where there is regularity, there is an opportunity for
automation.

This program leverages the regularity of my benchmark naming conventions to
automatically produce (for now) throughput plots vs input size.
